# Iris Flowers Classification using k-NN Algorithm

This project uses the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to classify Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset used in this project is the Iris Dataset, which includes 150 samples of Iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

# The project involves the following steps:
* Data collection and preparation
* Data exploration and visualization
* Training and testing data division
* Feature scaling
* Model building using k-NN algorithm
* Model evaluation using accuracy score and confusion matrix
  
# Dataset
sklearn.datasets, load_iris

# Results
The model achieved an Mean square error of 15.4427 %
